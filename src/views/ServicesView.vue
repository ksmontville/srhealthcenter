        <p class="body-text text-body-1 text-white">
          Danielle Isham, our Care Coordinator, teams up with Orange County Child Center and the Family Place with the
          free weekly playgroup for families and caregivers with children birth to age five at the Red Door Church in South Royalton.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text text-body-1 text-white my-4">
          The playgroup is a great way for families to connect, find out about other resources in the area and provide
          conversations and written information about child development and parenting. Throughout the year we explore
          activities that support fine motor and large motor development through crafts and manipulatives.
          The room has many toys to expand the imagination and help little ones learn social cues, and we always end the
          morning with some stories and nutritious snacks.  During the summer months we enjoy the outside with a large set
          of swings and places to climb. We hope you will join us  on Wednesdays from 9:30-11 AM!
        </p>
        <p class="body-text text-body-1 text-white my-4">
          The playgroups are funded by the Agency of Human Services, Department for Children and Families,
          Child Development Division through a Vermont Parent Child Center Network master grant.
        </p>
