    <p class="text-h6 text-primary font-weight-bold my-4">Our Vaccine Philosophy</p>
    <p class="body-text text-body-1 text-white">
      Our practice believes that all children should receive the recommended vaccines according to the guidelines
      provided by the AAP and the CDC. Vaccines are safe and effective in preventing diseases and health complications
      in children and young adults. Regular vaccinations help children ward off infections, and are administered as one
      of the safest and best methods of disease prevention.
    </p>
    <p class="body-text text-body-1 text-white my-4">
      We are happy to discuss your concerns about vaccines at your child's next visit.
