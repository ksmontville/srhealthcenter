        <a href="https://www.healthhubvt.org/" target="_blank">HealthHUB</a> was started in the 1990s by Robert Wood Johnson Foundation grants.
        It is a non-profit, 501(c3) organization. HealthHUB operates in collaboration with the
        South Royalton Health Center providing school based health care. Our shared vision is to make
        comprehensive health services available to children in a  location that is readily accessible to all,
        thereby improving their overall health and wellbeing, helping them be ready to learn.

      <p class="text-h6 text-primary text-center font-weight-bold my-8">Why School Based?</p>
      <p class="body-text text-body-1 text-white">
        Since school is where students spend a considerable part of their day, providing health services, there are many benefits.

              <strong>Parents benefit</strong> by not losing time from work and getting prompt treatment for their children.

              <v-icon :icon="mdiHospital" class="mx-2" color="primary"/>
              <strong>Students and teachers benefit</strong> by having more class time because appointments are scheduled in
              coordination with the student’s schedule.

              <strong>Everyone benefits</strong> by having a health care professional regularly in the school available for questions
              and able to provide accurate information to children in a timely and friendly manner.
